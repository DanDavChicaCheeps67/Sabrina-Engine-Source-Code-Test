-------------------------

Currently working on a game inspired by the Sonic-the-Hedgehog and RockMan series of games for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo. 
Code is mostly inspired from LazyFoo' Productions' Tutorial series on SDL2 and from the SDL Wiki along with help from the Anons at 8chan.moe and Frenschan.com with their /agdg/ threads and /agdg/ wiki.

This page is mainly to show off for a school project I'm currently working on so please excuse some of the errors and missing peices in the code as I do hope to fix them as soon as I can.

If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask.

Sincerly,
  Dan Cheeps
